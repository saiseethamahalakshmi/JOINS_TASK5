# 🧩 SQL Joins Mastery - Task 5

## 🎯 Objective:
To explore and understand how to merge data from multiple tables using different types of SQL JOINs.

## 🗂️ Tables Used:
- **Customers**: Stores customer details
- **Orders**: Stores order history

## 🔧 Tools:
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

## 📌 Join Types Covered:
| Join Type   | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| INNER JOIN  | Only customers with orders                       |
| LEFT JOIN   | All customers, with or without orders            |
| RIGHT JOIN  | All orders, even if customers don't exist        |
| FULL JOIN   | Every customer and every order, matched or not   |

## 💡 Fun Insight:
Even if Diana didn't order anything, she still shows up in LEFT JOIN! And someone with order ID 5 sneaked into RIGHT JOIN even though they're not a customer 😅.

## ✅ Outcome:
I now know how to combine tables using various join techniques and make MY data dance together!
